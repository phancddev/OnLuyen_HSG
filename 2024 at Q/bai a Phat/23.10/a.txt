B. Largest Number

Time limit per test: 3 seconds
Memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

You are given an integer 
𝑁
N. Arrange the numbers 
1
,
2
,
…
,
𝑁
1,2,…,N (all written in decimal representation) in a way so that the resulting number, written in decimal expansion, is the largest. For example, if 
𝑁
=
10
N=10, the resulting number is 98765432110.

Given two integers 
𝑁
N and 
𝐾
K, find the 
𝐾
K-th leftmost digit from such number representation, or 
−
1
−1 if the resulting number has less than 
𝐾
K digits.

Input
The first line contains an integer 
𝑇
T 
(
1
≤
𝑇
≤
100
)
(1≤T≤100), the number of test cases. Each of the following 
𝑇
T lines contains two numbers 
𝑁
N and 
𝐾
K 
(
0
<
𝑁
,
𝐾
≤
1
0
18
)
(0<N,K≤10 
18
 ).

Output
For each test case, output the 
𝐾
K-th leftmost digit of the resulting number on a single line, or 
−
1
−1 if that digit does not exist.
